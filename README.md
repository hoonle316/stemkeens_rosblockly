## System Requirements

This project has been tested with the following setup:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **ROS2 Distribution**: Humble
- **colcon**: 0.10.0 or later
- **Python**: 3.8 or later

It may also work on other environments, but these are the versions I have confirmed.

## Project Introduction
**Stemkeens Rosblockly** allows you to easily configure a ROS2 robot model using a block-based coding interface, automatically generating URDF files that can be used in Gazebo simulations and visualizations in RViz2.

- It is designed for students and beginners, eliminating the need to write complex ROS2 code.
- Integration with `rosbridge_server` enables real-time monitoring and command transmission via a web browser.

## Features
- **Block Coding Interface**  
  - Offers a variety of blocks for defining links, joints, geometric shapes, materials, ROS2 Control elements, and Gazebo plugins.
- **Automatic URDF Generation**  
  - Blocks are converted into a URDF file, quickly outlining the robotâ€™s structure.
- **Gazebo and RViz2 Simulation**  
  - Provides launch files to simulate the robot in Gazebo and visualize it in RViz2.
